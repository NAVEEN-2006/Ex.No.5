# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS

## Aim  
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.  

---

## AI Tools Required  
- ChatGPT (or any other LLM tool)

---

## Explanation  

### Prompt Types  
- **Naïve Prompt (Unstructured):** Broad, vague, or unrefined instructions with minimal context.  
- **Basic Prompt (Structured):** Clear, detailed, and well-defined instructions that specify context, constraints, or desired output.  

### Methodology  
1. Define naïve and basic prompt pairs for the same tasks.  
2. Use multiple test scenarios:  
   - Creative Story Generation  
   - Factual Question Answering  
   - Summarization Task  
   - Advice/Recommendation Task  
3. Run experiments with ChatGPT:  
   - Input naïve prompt → record response.  
   - Input basic prompt → record response.  
4. Compare outputs based on:  
   - **Quality** (structure, richness, readability)  
   - **Accuracy** (factual correctness, relevance)  
   - **Depth** (level of detail, coverage of points)

### Comparative Table of Naïve vs. Basic Prompts  

| **Scenario** | **Naïve Prompt** | **Response (Naïve)** | **Basic Prompt** | **Response (Basic)** | **Comparison (Quality, Accuracy, Depth)** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Creative Story** | "Write a story about a dragon." | *"Once upon a time, a dragon lived in a cave. People were afraid of it, but one day it became friendly."* | "Write a 300-word story about a dragon who protects a village, including themes of bravery and sacrifice." | *"The dragon Arion guarded the mountain village from invaders. Though feared at first, he sacrificed his safety to save the villagers, earning their love and respect..."* | Basic prompt produces richer characters, themes, and emotional depth. |
| **Factual Q&A** | "Tell me about AI." | *"AI is artificial intelligence. It means machines that can think and learn. It is used in robots and computers."* | "Explain Artificial Intelligence in 200 words, covering definition, applications, and real-world examples." | *"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Applications include chatbots, medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection in banking..."* | Basic prompt provides better **accuracy** and **clarity**. |
| **Summarization** | "Summarize climate change." | *"Climate change is when the Earth gets hotter. Ice melts, sea levels rise, and weather changes."* | "Summarize climate change in under 150 words, focusing on causes, effects, and solutions." | *"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather. Causes include greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Effects are rising sea levels, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss. Solutions include renewable energy, afforestation, and sustainable policies."* | Basic prompt improves **clarity, relevance, and depth balance**. |
| **Advice / Recommendation** | "Give me some career advice." | *"You should work hard, learn new skills, and never give up."* | "Give me career advice as a computer science graduate in India, focusing on AI/ML opportunities." | *"As a CS graduate in India, focus on Python, TensorFlow, and data science tools. Build projects in AI/ML, join hackathons, and contribute to open-source. Explore careers in fintech, healthcare AI, and startups where demand for AI talent is high."* | Basic prompt gives **practical, tailored, and useful** advice. |

### Analysis  

1. **Quality**  
   - Naïve prompts: Produced generic, vague responses.  
   - Basic prompts: Generated structured, meaningful, and engaging content.  

2. **Accuracy**  
   - Naïve prompts: Often incomplete, lacking details.  
   - Basic prompts: Factually stronger and more relevant due to explicit context.  

3. **Depth**  
   - Naïve prompts: Surface-level, repetitive, lacking nuance.  
   - Basic prompts: Provided deeper insights, examples, and actionable guidance.  

4. **Special Case**  
   - In creative tasks, naïve prompts gave acceptable results, but structured prompts made content more coherent and reader-friendly.  

---

### Summary of Findings  

- Prompt clarity has a **direct impact** on the quality of AI-generated content.  
- **Basic (structured) prompts consistently outperform naïve prompts** in quality, accuracy, and depth.  
- Naïve prompts only work decently in broad creative contexts but still lack refinement.  
- For best results, prompts should include **context, constraints, and specific instructions** (e.g., word limits, themes, perspectives).

## Result  
The experiment was executed successfully.  
The comparative analysis clearly shows that **basic prompts produce more accurate, detailed, and useful outputs compared to naïve prompts**.
